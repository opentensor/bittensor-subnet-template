class StreamPrompting(bt.StreamingSynapse):
    """
    StreamPrompting is a specialized implementation of the `StreamingSynapse` tailored for prompting functionalities within
    the Bittensor network. This class is intended to interact with a streaming response that contains a sequence of tokens,
    which represent prompts or messages in a certain scenario.

    As a developer, when using or extending the `StreamPrompting` class, you should be primarily focused on the structure
    and behavior of the prompts you are working with. The class has been designed to seamlessly handle the streaming,
    decoding, and accumulation of tokens that represent these prompts.

    Attributes:
    - `roles` (List[str]): A list of roles involved in the prompting scenario. This could represent different entities
                           or agents involved in the conversation or use-case. They are immutable to ensure consistent
                           interaction throughout the lifetime of the object.

    - `messages` (List[str]): These represent the actual prompts or messages in the prompting scenario. They are also
                              immutable to ensure consistent behavior during processing.

    - `completion` (str): Stores the processed result of the streaming tokens. As tokens are streamed, decoded, and
                          processed, they are accumulated in the completion attribute. This represents the "final"
                          product or result of the streaming process.
    - `required_hash_fields` (List[str]): A list of fields that are required for the hash.

    Methods:
    - `process_streaming_response`: This method asynchronously processes the incoming streaming response by decoding
                                    the tokens and accumulating them in the `completion` attribute.

    - `deserialize`: Converts the `completion` attribute into its desired data format, in this case, a string.

    - `extract_response_json`: Extracts relevant JSON data from the response, useful for gaining insights on the response's
                               metadata or for debugging purposes.

    Note: While you can directly use the `StreamPrompting` class, it's designed to be extensible. Thus, you can create
    subclasses to further customize behavior for specific prompting scenarios or requirements.

        `process_streaming_response` is an asynchronous method designed to process the incoming streaming response from the
        Bittensor network. It's the heart of the StreamPrompting class, ensuring that streaming tokens, which represent
        prompts or messages, are decoded and appropriately managed.

        As the streaming response is consumed, the tokens are decoded from their 'utf-8' encoded format, split based on
        newline characters, and concatenated into the `completion` attribute. This accumulation of decoded tokens in the
        `completion` attribute allows for a continuous and coherent accumulation of the streaming content.

                      response is expected to be a set of tokens that can be decoded and split into individual messages or prompts.

        or when debugging response-related issues.

        Beyond just extracting the JSON data, the method also processes and structures the data for easier consumption
        and understanding. For instance, it extracts specific headers related to dendrite and axon, offering insights
        about the Bittensor network's internal processes. The method ultimately returns a dictionary with a structured
        view of the extracted data.

        Args:
            response: The response object from which to extract the JSON data. This object typically includes headers and
                      content which can be used to glean insights about the response.
