# **👁️ VISION**

Cancer is one of the most significant challenges of our time, and we believe that AI holds the key to addressing it. However, this solution should be accessible and free for everyone. Machine vision technology has long proven effective in early diagnosis, which is crucial for curing cancer. Yet, until now, it has largely remained in the realm of whitepapers. SAFESCAN is a project dedicated to aggregating and enhancing the best algorithms for detecting various types of cancer and providing free computational power for practical cancer detection. We aim to create open-source products that support cancer diagnosis for both patients and doctors.

To date, many crypto and AI projects, particularly those focused on medicine, have struggled to achieve real-world implementation due to various barriers. Our solution focuses on:

**🛠️ Development of Applications and Software:** Invest in the ongoing development and enhancement of our cancer detection applications and software to ensure they are at the cutting edge of technology.

**📝 Medical Device Registration:** Allocate funds to cover the costs associated with registering our solutions as medical devices, ensuring they meet all regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy.

**📢 Marketing and Awareness:** Implement comprehensive marketing strategies to raise awareness about our solutions and Bittensor project, making them known to both potential users and healthcare professionals.

**🤝 Collaboration and Networking:** Build strong networks with cancer organizations, researchers, and healthcare providers to facilitate the practical implementation and continuous improvement of our technology.

**📈Continuous Improvement of Algorithms:** Reward top researchers, maintain algorithms in the open domain, and constantly expand our anonymized cancer detection dataset through partnerships and user contributions.

**⚖️ Legislative Efforts:** Engage in legislative activities to support the recognition and adoption of AI-driven cancer detection technologies within the medical community.

By focusing on these areas, we aim to overcome the barriers to the practical use of AI in cancer detection and provide a solution that is accessible to everyone.

To expedite the process and navigate the complexities of medical certification, we are beginning our initiatives with authorized clinical trials. After completing clinical trials of our first project, **SELFSCAN** – an application for detecting skin cancer through self-made pictures – we will focus on its deployment as a Class II medical device in the USA and Europe, obtaining the necessary FDA and CE approvals.

Concurrently, with the help of the Bittensor community and our unique tokenomics supporting researchers, we will continuously improve the best cancer detection algorithms. This ensures that, by the time our products are brought to market, our solutions surpass all existing algorithms.

Subsequently, we will focus on detecting other types of cancer, starting with breast and lung cancer.

# **🌍 REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS**

Our SKIN SCAN app, accessible at [www.skin-scan.ai](http://www.skin-scan.ai/), is designed to bridge the gap between AI's proven efficiency in cancer detection and its limited real-world application. Despite numerous studies validating AI's potential in cancer detection, its use in everyday healthcare is still not widespread. Our app aims to change this by providing a user-friendly, accessible tool for early skin cancer detection.

Building on this foundation, we are developing dedicated software for breast cancer detection, utilizing advanced AI to offer accurate assessments. Following this, we will expand our focus to include lung and brain cancer detection solutions, aiming to make these life-saving technologies widely available and effective in clinical settings.

# **⚠️ WHY IS SAFESCAN SUBNET IMPORTANT?**

SAFE SCAN harnesses the power of the Bittensor network to address one of the world's most pressing issues: cancer detection. Researchers can contribute to refining detection algorithms and earn TAO, with additional royalties for those whose algorithms are integrated into our software. By focusing on obtaining large datasets, including paid and hard-to-access medical data, we ensure the development of superior models. Our decentralized, transparent system guarantees fair competition and protects against model overfitting. With strong community and validator support, we can expand to create and register standalone software for detecting other types of cancer. 

Additionally with Safe Scan, we can significantly broaden awareness of Bittensor's capabilities and resonate with a more general audience. This will be crucial for the network's growth and increasing market cap, attracting both large and microinvestors.

# **📢 MARKETING**

Our first goal is to develop the best skin cancer detection algorithm and establish ourselves as a recognized leader in cancer detection. We aim not only to create the most popular and widely accessible skin cancer detection app but also to demonstrate Bittensor's power. We plan to spread awareness through partnerships with skin cancer foundations, growth hacking strategies like affiliate links for unlocking premium features, and promotional support from Apple and Google stores, aiming to reach over 1 million users within 18 months.  And every app launch will display “proudly powered by BITTENSOR.”

However, brand recognition is just the beginning. Our marketing strategy will focus on creating hype by engaging bloggers, reaching to celebrities affected by skin cancer, and sending articles to major tech, health, and news outlets. We will leverage the current interest in AI and blockchain to showcase the life-saving potential of these technologies.

# **💰 TOKENOMY & ECONOMY**

**🪙 UNIQUE TOKENOMY**

Our tokenomics are uniquely designed to drive research and development of new algorithms while also supporting real-life applications.
**Competitions** Safe Scan organizes ongoing competitions focused on cancer detection using machine learning, providing a structured environment for participants to develop and test their models.

You can find comprehensive details about competition scheduling, dataset release, model submission, evaluation, configuration, and development tools here: [LINK]

**Incentives**: The winner of each competition receives the entire reward pool for that specific competition. The reward pool is determined by the total emission allocated for miners, divided by the number of competitions being held.

If a miner stays at the top position for more than 30 days, their rewards start to decrease gradually. Every 7 days after the initial 30 days, their share of the rewards decreases by 10%. This reduction continues until their share reaches a minimum of 10% of the original reward.

**📈 SELF-SUSTAINING ECONOMY**

Although our primary focus is on using our subnet to save lives with state-of-the-art algorithms and custom-made software while promoting the power of Bittensor computing worldwide, our long-term goal is to establish a self-sustaining economy.

We aim to keep our cancer detection app and software free for those who need it most: regular people and public hospitals, especially in developing countries with limited medical personnel, while offering paid solutions for the private healthcare sector and developed countries.

- Premium features for paid users (e.g., more lesions for detection, exporting data to doctors, etc.)
- Support from sponsors, donors, cancer foundations, and companies that align with our mission
- Rewards for miners and validators for generating economic value (e.g., analyzing mammography data for private healthcare)
- Proceeds generated from sponsors and end-users will be distributed among the network's participants.

# **👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 TEAM COMPOSITION**
