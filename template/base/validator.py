        Initiates and manages the main loop for the miner on the Bittensor network. The main loop handles graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupts and logs unforeseen errors.

        1. Check for registration on the Bittensor network.
        2. Continuously forwards queries to the miners on the network, rewarding their responses and updating the scores accordingly.

            - The function leverages the global configurations set during the initialization of the miner.
